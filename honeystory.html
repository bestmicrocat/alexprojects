<p><h3><i>The neighbors' bees</i></h3><br>
Author: Rusty Burlew
</p>    
<p>I’m sure you’ve heard all kinds of horror stories about beekeepers and their neighbors–usually threats, warnings, or fears of some type. <br>
Well, here’s one I can’t get my mind around. It was relayed to me last summer, soon after our new neighbors began tending their garden:
</p>    

<p>Wife to husband, as she pauses with a trowel in hand: “Wow, there are so many bees around here! I’ve never seen so many bees. <br>
They’re all over the flowers. Do you think they will sting the kids?”
</p>

<p>Husband to wife: “Don’t worry, hon. They’re the neighbors’ bees.”</p>

<p>Wife to husband: “Oh, I didn’t know that. Okay, then.” And she goes back to work, ignoring the bees. <br> 
End of conversation.</p>

<p>Seriously, I don’t get it. Because they belong to us they aren’t threatening? They don’t sting? They’re kid-friendly? <br>
Do they think I’ve given them instructions? “Mind your manners over there or no t.v. tonight!”</p>

<p>Does ownership make bees nice? Domesticated instead of wild? Civilized and orderly? Respectful of private property?<br> 
Educated, perhaps?
</p>
<p>Or are they still mean, threatening, and sting happy, but because they belong next door you take it in stride? <br>
Like neighborhood dogs, do you accept them as a fact of life?
</p>
<p>Yes, I am grateful, but if anyone can explain it to me, you have my rapt attention. The more I think about it, the curiouser it gets.
